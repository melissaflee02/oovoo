## Synopsis

Oovoo is a social platform intended to enable smarter ridesharing within Stanford communities of all sizes, ranging from friend groups to entire student organizations. Carpool assignments are often difficult to figure out, inspiring us to create a mobile app to replace complicated spreadsheets and sometimes-contentious conversations with a simple, intuitive interface that allows each driver and rider to register their needs. Using Oovoo will save community members time, money, and frustration in arranging transportation that works for them.

Through Oovoo, users can join communities of interest, view and post upcoming trips, and register themselves as a driver or passenger for expected travel plans. Drivers have the option to specify the type of vehicle they are bringing, the number of seats available, and a pickup location and time. Interested passengers may choose to add themselves to vehicles that fit their schedules and see who else they will be traveling with. By default, all new users are added to the Stanford community :)
